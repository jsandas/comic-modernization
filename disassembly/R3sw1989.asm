; enemies move every tick. There is a bug with fast enemies in some behavior
; types, however. Though they start in ENEMY_RESTRAINT_MOVE_EVERY_TICK, their
; enemy.restraint field increments on every tick, until it overflows to
; ENEMY_RESTRAINT_MOVE_THIS_TICK and they become a slow enemy. The bug affects
; ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_LEAP, ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_ROLL, and ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_SEEK, but not
; ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_BOUNCE and ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_SHY. Additionally,
; ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_ROLL enemies become slow if they pass a tick where Comic is
; directly above or below them and not moving left or right, and
; ENEMY_BEHAVIOR_SEEK enemies become slow if they bump into a solid map tile.
