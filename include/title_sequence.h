 * Title Sequence System
 *
 * Replicates the original DOS title_sequence() from game_main.c:
 *   1. Display title screen (SYS000.EGA) with fade-in + title music
 *   2. Display story screen (SYS001.EGA) with fade-in, wait for key
 *   3. Load game UI background (SYS003.EGA) into HUD texture
 *   4. Display items screen (SYS004.EGA), wait for key
 *   5. Stop music, transition to gameplay
 *
 * Palette fade effects:
 *   The original DOS code calls palette_darken() then palette_fade_in()
 *   to produce a smooth transition from black when each screen appears.
 *   In SDL2 this is replicated by performing a multi-step color/palette
 *   transition on the rendered content, emulating the original palette
 *   register fades rather than using a simple full-screen alpha overlay.
 * Timing:
 *   Original uses wait_n_ticks(14) ≈ 770 ms for the title screen delay.
 *   Each tick is ~55 ms (DOS 18.2 Hz timer).
