# Captain Comic Modernization Plan

## Project Overview

This project modernizes the classic 1988 DOS game *The Adventures of Captain Comic* for modern systems. The goal is to recreate the game using modern technologies while maintaining behavioral fidelity to the original.

**Original Game:**
- Platform: DOS (x86-16 assembly)
- Graphics: EGA 320x200, 16 colors
- Input: Keyboard/joystick
- Audio: PC speaker

**Target Platforms:**
- Windows, macOS, Linux
- Modern resolutions with optional scaling
- Modern input devices
- Cross-platform audio

## Technology Stack

### Core Libraries
- **SDL2**: Graphics, audio, input handling
  - Chosen for performance, broad compatibility, and low-level control
  - Better for faithful DOS emulation than SFML
  - Extensive features and mature ecosystem

- **C++17**: Modern language features while maintaining C compatibility
  - Easier to port from C refactor
  - Object-oriented design for maintainability

- **CMake**: Cross-platform build system
  - Simple configuration

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All 8 levels load correctly
- [x] Stage transitions work (left/right boundaries)
- [x] Doors function properly with keys
- [x] Level data matches original exactly

**Implementation Notes:**
- Door collision detection checks Y coordinate (exact) and X coordinate (within 3 units)
- Door Key requirement implemented
- Door transitions call load_new_level() or load_new_stage() as appropriate
- Source door tracking for reciprocal positioning (entering target stage via door)
- **Unit-test helper:** `g_skip_load_on_door` flag allows activate_door() to update
  state without actually loading levels/stages, keeping tests deterministic
  and avoiding reciprocal-door warnings when using minimal test levels.
- Alt key (SDL KMOD_ALT modifier) opens doors; 'K' key grants door key (debug)
- Level/stage loading system integrated:
  - load_new_level() sets current_level_ptr and loads tileset graphics
  - load_new_stage() loads stage tiles into physics system (current_tiles)
  - Reciprocal door search finds matching door in destination stage
  - Camera positioned relative to Comic on stage load
  - Initial spawn: Forest stage 0 at position (14, 12)
- Stage boundary transitions:
  - Triggered at left edge (comic_x == 0) or right edge (comic_x >= 254)
  - Checks stage->exit_l or stage->exit_r for target stage
  - If EXIT_UNUSED (0xFF), stops movement
  - Otherwise, transitions to new stage at opposite edge
  - Checkpoint updated to preserve Y position and edge position
  - source_door_level_number = -1 marks as boundary (not door) transition

## Developer Tools & Debug Features

**Status:** Complete
**Implementation Date:** 2026-02-15
**Goal:** Provide development and debugging aids for testing and validation

### CheatSystem Class
A centralized system for managing debug cheats and development tools. Activated via `--debug` command-line flag; all cheats remain silently disabled without it.

**Architecture:**
- Implemented as `CheatSystem` class following RAII pattern (matching `GraphicsSystem`)
- Global instance `g_cheats` initialized at startup
- Input processed during main game loop after regular keyboard handling
- Command-line parsing in `main()` for debug mode activation

**Features:**

1. **Noclip Mode (F1)**
   - Disables collision detection entirely
   - Player walks through all solid tiles and obstacles
   - Useful for: Testing level layouts, debugging physics edge cases, exploring level design

2. **Level Warp (F2)**
   - Interactive two-step menu: select level (0-7), then stage (0-2)
   - Levels: LAKE (0), FOREST (1), SPACE (2), BASE (3), CAVE (4), SHED (5), CASTLE (6), COMP (7)
   - Resets player position to safe spawn (20, 14) on warp
   - Clears velocity and jump state
   - Useful for: Testing specific levels without playing through, accessing late-game content

3. **Position Warp (F4)**
   - Teleport player to specific X,Y coordinates
   - Input validation: X (0-255), Y (0-19)
   - Auto-adjusts camera to keep player on-screen
   - Resets velocity
   - Useful for: Testing collision at specific tiles, placing player near objectives, testing boundaries

4. **Debug Overlay (F3)**
   - Semi-transparent overlay in top-left corner displaying:
     - Player X,Y coordinates (in cyan text)
     - Current level and stage (in cyan text)
     - Visual velocity bar (red, vertical)
     - Visual momentum bar (blue, horizontal)
     - Noclip indicator (green square when active)
   - Uses SDL2_ttf for text rendering with system font fallback chain
   - Useful for: Verifying position during complex maneuvers, monitoring physics state, visual feedback on cheat status

5. **Item Granting (F5)**
   - Interactive menu to select and grant any item (0-9)
   - Items available:
     - 0 = Corkscrew (fireball vertical oscillation)
     - 1 = Door Key (unlock doors)
     - 2 = Boots (increased jump power)
     - 3 = Lantern (castle lighting)
     - 4 = Teleport Wand (special teleport)
     - 5 = Gems (treasure 1/3)
     - 6 = Crown (treasure 2/3)
     - 7 = Gold (treasure 3/3)
     - 8 = Blastola Cola (increase firepower)
     - 9 = Shield (HP refill)
   - Useful for: Testing item effects without playing through levels, debugging item-dependent mechanics, validating item collection logic

**Console Logging:**
- All cheat activations logged to stdout with `[CHEAT]` prefix
- Input validation feedback (e.g., invalid coordinates)
- Level/stage warp confirmations
- Door key grant/removal notifications
- Users can see cheat activity in terminal even if overlay disabled

**Command-Line Interface:**
```bash
./captain_comic --debug    # Enable all cheats and F-key controls
./captain_comic --help     # Display help message
./captain_comic            # Normal mode (cheats disabled)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Multi-step input handling for complex cheats (level warp, position warp, item granting)
- Input buffering for coordinate entry with backspace support
- Console prompts guide users through multi-step operations
- Proper cleanup of system resources (SDL_ttf font) in destructor
- Font loading with cross-platform fallback (Menlo, Courier on macOS; DejaVuSansMono on Linux; lucidaconsole on Windows)
- Item granting directly calls `ActorSystem::apply_item_effect()` for all 10 item types

**Technical Specs:**
- Dependencies: SDL2_ttf (added to CMakeLists.txt)

  - [x] Playing state
  - [x] Paused state
  - [x] Game over state
  - [x] Victory state

**Implementation Progress Notes:**
- Main loop uses an explicit runtime `GameState` enum (`Playing`, `Paused`, `Victory`, `GameOver`, `Exiting`).
- Pause/resume and terminal flow (victory/game-over sequence handoff) transition through `GameState`.
- Teleportation, stage boundaries, and door transitions are fully integrated into the tick pipeline.
- DOS-faithful victory countdown and beam-out sequence implemented.

**Success Criteria:**
- Game loop runs at consistent 60 FPS
- All game states transition correctly
- Full playthrough possible from start to end
- Win/lose conditions work properly

## Development Workflow

### Iteration Strategy
1. Implement small, testable modules
2. Validate against C refactor reference
3. Compare behavior to original (DOSBox)
4. Fix discrepancies before moving on
5. Commit working increments frequently

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing:** Individual functions (physics, collision)
- **Integration Testing:** Subsystems working together
- **Scenario Testing:** Specific game situations
- **Playthrough Testing:** Full level completion
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure fixes don't break existing features

### Reference Workflow
1. Read function in `src/*.c` from comic-c
2. Understand logic and data structures
3. Port to modern C++ with SDL2
4. Cross-reference assembly for edge cases
5. Test behavior matches original

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Modular Design:** Separate physics, rendering, actors, audio
- **Data-Driven:** Levels defined in data structures, not code
- **Modern Idioms:** Use C++ features for clarity (classes, vectors)
- **Compatibility Layer:** Abstract DOS-specific code (video memory, interrupts)

### Rendering
- **Native Resolution:** Render at original 320x200 internally
- **Scaling:** Scale up to modern resolutions (640x480, 1280x960, etc.)
- **Filtering:** Nearest-neighbor for pixel-perfect look
- **SDL_Renderer:** Use hardware acceleration when available

### Input
- **Keyboard Primary:** Arrow keys + Space (jump), Alt (open), etc.
- **Configurable:** Allow remapping
- **Gamepad Support:** Optional, map to modern controllers

### Audio
- **SDL_mixer:** Modern audio library
- **Synthesized Sounds:** Recreate PC speaker beeps/tones
- **Music Playback:** Port original music data or recreate

### Performance
- **Target:** Solid 60 FPS on modest hardware
- **Optimization:** Only where needed (profiling-driven)
- **Memory:** Keep original footprint small, modern extras optional
