# Captain Comic Modernization Plan

## Project Overview

This project modernizes the classic 1988 DOS game *The Adventures of Captain Comic* for modern systems. The goal is to recreate the game using modern technologies while maintaining behavioral fidelity to the original.

**Original Game:**
- Platform: DOS (x86-16 assembly)
- Graphics: EGA 320x200, 16 colors
- Input: Keyboard/joystick
- Audio: PC speaker

**Target Platforms:**
- Windows, macOS, Linux
- Modern resolutions with optional scaling
- Modern input devices
- Cross-platform audio

## Technology Stack

### Core Libraries
- **SDL2**: Graphics, audio, input handling
  - Chosen for performance, broad compatibility, and low-level control
  - Better for faithful DOS emulation than SFML
  - Extensive features and mature ecosystem

- **C++17**: Modern language features while maintaining C compatibility
  - Easier to port from C refactor
  - Object-oriented design for maintainability

- **CMake**: Cross-platform build system
  - Simple configuration
  - IDE integration

### Reference Materials

## Development Workflow

### Iteration Strategy
1. Implement small, testable modules
2. Validate against C refactor reference
3. Compare behavior to original (DOSBox)
4. Fix discrepancies before moving on
5. Commit working increments frequently

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing:** Individual functions (physics, collision)
- **Integration Testing:** Subsystems working together
- **Scenario Testing:** Specific game situations
- **Playthrough Testing:** Full level completion
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure fixes don't break existing features

### Reference Workflow
1. Read function in `src/*.c` from comic-c
2. Understand logic and data structures
3. Port to modern C++ with SDL2
4. Cross-reference assembly for edge cases
5. Test behavior matches original

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Modular Design:** Separate physics, rendering, actors, audio
- **Data-Driven:** Levels defined in data structures, not code
- **Modern Idioms:** Use C++ features for clarity (classes, vectors)
- **Compatibility Layer:** Abstract DOS-specific code (video memory, interrupts)

### Rendering
- **Native Resolution:** Render at original 320x200 internally
- **Scaling:** Scale up to modern resolutions (640x480, 1280x960, etc.)
- **Filtering:** Nearest-neighbor for pixel-perfect look
- **SDL_Renderer:** Use hardware acceleration when available

### Input
- **Keyboard Primary:** Arrow keys + Space (jump), Alt (open), etc.
- **Configurable:** Allow remapping
- **Gamepad Support:** Optional, map to modern controllers

### Audio
- **SDL_mixer:** Modern audio library
- **Synthesized Sounds:** Recreate PC speaker beeps/tones
- **Music Playback:** Port original music data or recreate

### Performance
- **Target:** Solid 60 FPS on modest hardware
- **Optimization:** Only where needed (profiling-driven)
- **Memory:** Keep original footprint small, modern extras optional
